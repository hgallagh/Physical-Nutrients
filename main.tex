\section*{Disclaimer}
This is just an online recipe book I made out of boredom and that I did not want to have constant ads whenever I cooked something. This may be not the type of nutrients you want or need. Some of these foods are acquired tastes or simply what I'm cooking on a budget so I can buy more important things...i.e. education.  
\section*{Bare Essentials}
Saving for something big? \\ 

Oatmeal and skim milk for breakfast \\ 
Some bitter super green that no one else wants to eat as a salad for lunch \\ 
Family pack of mushrooms, Russell potatoes, Hunt's tomato paste, garlic, hot peppers, family pack of Wegman's chicken or pork (freeze -3), any array of those 99 cent beans. Make your own sourdough with proper unrefined flour...scale not necessary but fun.\\ 
Tangerines or store brand ice cream for dessert. 

\section*{Ingredients}
When I'm older with more knowledge and money, these are the items I'd always like to have on hand.

Vegetables & Fruits & Dairy & Meat & Snacks \\

Mushroom   & Orange & Kefir & Pork Chop & Saltines 
\end{tabular}

\section*{Breakfast}

\subsection*{Eggs}
Make a quick x of oil onto a small nonstick pan. Quickly and not at all delicately crack the egg. Break the egg along the line and into the pan. Turn the heat down and move the egg around a little to make sure it does not stick.   

\subsection*{Yogurt}

\subsection*{Banana}
Grab a banana and worry about breakfast later.

\section*{Food with friends}

\subsection*{Potato Skins} 
Microwave the potato halfway and poke with fork. The halfway is to make sure the potato is not too fragile that when you're carving out the basin the potato doesn't break. Let cool...ideally do something else... use a spoon to carve and make the shape. \\ 

Cut up a ton of chives (green onions) into half the potato group. \\ 

\section*{Weird Health Drinks after Food with Friends}

\subsection*{Witches Brew} 
For when your sinuses are clogged. \\ 
Chop up a medium size onion, squeeze a quarter cup of lemon juice, that's the main part then strain it in whatever you want. I use my French press out of not wanting to buy something else. I'll usually add some green or breakfast tea to mask the taste of the onion since it's a lot to get used to. 

\subsection*{Carrot Juice} 

\subsection*{Green Juice}
